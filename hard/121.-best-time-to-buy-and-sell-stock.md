# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. Return the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying on one day and selling on another.

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
```

***

### Intuition

* To identify the max profit, we need to buy on the day when price is lowest & sell on the day its highest till the day `i`.

### Approach

* Iterate over the array store the `minPrice` & `maxPrice` seen till now.
* If we have to change the `minPrice` it mean we are buying on that day so `maxPrice` also needs to be reset.

### Complexity

* **Time complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We iterate over the prices only once.
* **Space complexity** : $\text{O}(1)$
  * There is no extra space needed.

### Code

```java
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
	int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE, maxPrice = Integer.MIN_VALUE,maxProfitTillNow = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; ++i) {
		// If current day price is the lowest 
		// reset the maxPrice also as it means we are buying on current day
		if(prices[i] < minPrice ) {
			minPrice = prices[i];
			maxPrice = prices[i];
		} else {
			// Update the maxPrice by comparing price with current day price
			maxPrice = Math.max(maxPrice,prices[i]);
		
			// Recalculate the max profit we can achieve till date
			maxProfitTillNow = Math.max(maxProfitTillNow,maxPrice-minPrice);
		}
	}
  
return Math.max(maxProfitTillNow,maxPrice - minPrice);

}
```
