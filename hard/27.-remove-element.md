# 27. Remove Element

Given an array and a `val` remove all it occurrences in-place and return the number of remaining elements

```
Input: 
nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
```

if there are `k` occurrence of `val` change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`.

***

### Intuition

* An element shifts by the occurrence amount of `val` before it.

### Approach

* Start from beginning of the array tracking the occurrence of `val` (lets say its tracked by `i`)
* Move an elements `i` steps forward in array if there are `i` occurrence of `val` before it.

### Complexity

* **Time complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * as we iterate the array only once
* **Space complexity** : $\text{O}(1)$
  * No extra space is needed as everything is done in place

### Code

```java
public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
	// This will track the occurrence count of the val
	int placesToBeMovedBy = 0;
	
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
	    // If current value is val increase the occurrence count and continue 
		if(nums[i] == val) {
			placesToBeMovedBy++;
			continue;
		} 
	
		// If there is an occurence of val we can overwrite it
		nums[i - placesToBeMovedBy] = nums[i];
	}
	
	return nums.length - placesToBeMovedBy;
}
```
