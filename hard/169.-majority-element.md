# 169. Majority Element

Given an array find the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. ( assume such majority element always exists in the array. )

```ad-warning
Solve the problem in linear time and in $\text{O}(1)$ space
```

***

### Intuition

* We can use the simple voting mechanism where anything different is considered a vote against.
  * Only the majority element will have vote in his favour.

### Approach

* Track the `candidate` & the number of `vote` i.e its occurrence.
  * If we encounter an element different from the `candidate` decrease the `vote` count
  * If for the current `candidate` the `votes` become `0` replace it
* At the end only the max occurring element will remain.

### Complexity

* **Time complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We iterate the array only once
* **Space complexity** : $\text{O}(1)$
  * No extra space is needed

### Code

```java
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
	// we count the votes 
	// number of votes will be > 0 only for the majority element
	int candidate = -1, votes = 0; 
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) { 
		// if votes is 0 then replace the candiate
		if(votes == 0) { 
			candidate = nums[i];
			votes++; 
		} else if (candidate == nums[i]) { 
			votes++; 
		} else {
			// if the element is different consider it as vote againts 
			votes--; 
		} 
	} 
	return candidate; 
} 
```

### Another Solution

#### Intuition

* We can track the occurrence of each number and then find the max occurring element
  * This approach will need extra space

#### Complexity

* **Time complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We iterate the array twice only
    * once to populate the occurrence map
    * once to find the max occurring element
* **Space complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We maintain the count of each element

#### Code

```java
public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {

	Map<Integer,Integer> occurrence = new HashMap<>();
	
	for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
		occurrence.put(nums[i],occurrence.getOrDefault(nums[i],0)+1);
	}

	Integer maxOccurringElement = null;
	for (Integer key : occurrence.keySet()) {
		if(maxOccurringElement == null || occurrence.get(key) > occurrence.get(maxOccurringElement)) {
		maxOccurringElement = key;
		}
	}

	return maxOccurringElement;
}
```
