# 274. H-Index

Given an array where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their $i^{th}$ paper, calcuate the researcher's h-index.

```ad-info
The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.
```

### Intuition

* H-index is `x` if researcher has published at least `x` papers with at least `x` citation.
* The maximum H-index will be the amount of papers published
  * Any paper having citation more than the amount of papers published is useless
* Start from the maximum citation and move towards 0
  * If amount of papers having citation `x` is greater or equal to `x` it the h-index

### Approach

* Store amount of paper with citation $i$ in an array
  * the array needs to be of length equal to number of paper published
* If a paper has citation greater than number of papers published add it to the max citation value.
* Iterate from end and for citation $i$ sum the paper with citation $\geq i$ if its greater than $i$ return as thats the h-index.

### Complexity

* **Time complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We iterate the array only once
* **Space complexity** : $\text{O}(n)$
  * We use space to store the papers with citation $i$.

## Code

```java
public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
	// use extra space as single paper with x citation will mean score of 1
	int[] countOfPapers = new int[citations.length + 1];
	
	for (int i = 0; i < citations.length; ++i) {
		if (citations[i] > citations.length) {
			countOfPapers[citations.length]++;
		} else {
			countOfPapers[citations[i]]++;
		}
	}
	
	int papersTillNow = 0;
	for (int i = citations.length; i >= 0; --i) {
		papersTillNow += countOfPapers[i];
		if (papersTillNow >= i) return i;
	}
	
	
	return 0;
}
```
